# Sprint 3 - Technical challenge
## Story: Invoice APP...

> An app to generate invoices, the api should consume data from other external apis, communicate with a web frontend, and even a mobile version interacting with the user who will enter data such as product, quantity, price etc, and finally the app has the possibility to share the generated invoice with third parties via sharing an https link.

## Requirements
- Web application based on react and/or Vue
- Flutter-based mobile application
- Multicloud hosting at your discretion (Heroku, Versel, AWS, Cloudfare, Azure, GCP...), but you will have to support your choice.
- Documentation
- Scrum Methodology, Kanban board

## Features
### 1. Web application

* [ ] Form to insert user data (name, email, address).

* [ ] Form for entering invoice data (product, quantity, price, tax, total).

* [ ] Invoice items table (dynamic update with the insertion of new items).

* [ ] Space for inputting observations for the client.

* [ ] Invoice preview.

* [ ] Print/download pdf of the invoice.

* [ ] Sending an invoice to the customer's email.

* [ ] User authentication.

### 2. Api

* [ ] Persistence of user and invoice data.

* [ ] Authentication and authorization of users.

* [ ] Consume data from external APIs, a currency converter? An api that gives you the location written by the geographic coordinates? The choice is yours, be creative ;).

### 3. Mobile Application

* [ ] Form to insert user data (name, email, address).

* [ ] Form for entering invoice data (product, quantity, price, tax, total).

* [ ] Invoice items table (dynamic update with the insertion of new items).

* [ ] Space for inputting observations for the client.

* [ ] Invoice preview.

* [ ] Print/download pdf of the invoice.

* [ ] Sending an invoice to the customer's email.

* [ ] User authentication.

### Extras

* [ ] TDD? Do you think it's worth the try?

* [ ] Ever heard of microfrontends? Can you get Vue and React working side by side in the same app?

* [ ] Clean architecture, can you implement the good practices advocated by Uncle Bob?

Feel free to develop your solution as best you can.

## Expected architecture

1. Just don't overthink it.

2. https://dev.to/nilanth/react-architecture-for-enterprise-application-3pnh

## Submission

1. Make sure you have access to the repository and communicate with your development team, make your decisions and build your best invoice generation app.

2. Make frequent commits to the team repository (don't leave it to the last day to "push" the code, you know things happen).

3. Publish the web application and api on a cloud provider of your choice, for mobile choose the best way to publish (if it's already in stores even better!).

4. Don't wait until the last day to complain to the team's "DevOps Engineer" that the application isn't working or isn't online.

5. Submit the link on the team channel.
